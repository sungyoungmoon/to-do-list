## Iteration 2 Planning

### Iteration 1 Velocity

#### Statistics

Iteration 1 total work done = 615 minutes

Iteration 1 total time alloted = 2160 minutes

#### Calculation

Iteration 1 velocity = iteration 1 total work done / iteration 1 total time alloted

Iteration 1 velocity = 615 minutes / 2160 minutes

Iteration 1 velocity = 0.285


### Iteration 2 Predicted Work time

Due to us being able to have our first meeting earlier for iteration 2 and less outside work, we decided to increase our alloted time accordingly, from 2160 to 2880. This meant everyone would spend 1 hour per day on this assignment, which we felt was reasonable as midterms finally concluded.

Iteration 2 work time = Iteration 1 velocity * Iteration 2 time allotted

Iteration 2 work time = 0.285 * 2880 minutes

Iteration 2 work time = 821 minutes = 13.7 hours


### Iteration 2 Estimates

- User Story 7: Focus mode that filters by context (Medium) [2 hr] 
- User Story 3: Manage one-time pending goals (Medium) [4 hr] 
- User Story 4: Add/delete recurring goals for specific date (Low) [2 hr] 
- User Story 2: Add/finish/uncomplete tomorrowâ€™s goals (Low) [4 hr] 
- Loose Task 2: Test Iteration 2 [1 hr] 
- Loose Task 3: Reformatting Scenario-Based Milestone Tests [15 min]
- Loose Task 4: Test Scenario-Based System Tests [45 min] 
- Loose Task 5: Integrate Context into Recurrence [1 hr] 

### Iteration 2 Decision

We decided to include all User Stories and Loose Tasks except for User Story 4: Add/delete recurring goals for specific date (Low) [2 hr] in our iteration 2, for a total estimate of 13 hours of work, slightly less than our predicted 13.7 hours of work. We decided to leave out US4 because it had the lowest priority amongst our user stories, and because it had the highest potential of causing unexpected slowdowns due to having to mess with the Androidd Calendar. We decided that we would only attempt this user story if we had more time than we predicted.

## Results

We ultimately were able to finish all User Stories and Tasks because our estimates were actually pessimistic this time for some user stories, which led to us having more time available to also finish US4, which we initially decided to leave out.
